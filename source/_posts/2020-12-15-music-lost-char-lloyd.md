"Lost" is a song by English singer Cher Lloyd from her upcoming third studio album. Released on April 24, 2020,[^1] under Universal Music Group, the song is the second single released off of Lloyd's upcoming album, following "M.I.A" in 2019.[^2] An accompanying video directed by Raja Virdi was released on April 24.[^3] Writing for The Guardian, Leonie Cooper said: "There is something heartening about this largely harmless return."[^4]

# Background and production

After releasing her album Sorry I'm Late in 2014, Lloyd went on a musical hiatus before releasing several songs between 2016 and 2019. After signing a new record deal with Polydor Records & Universal Music Germany, she released "None of My Business" in 2018 and "M.I.A" in 2019. 2020 brought "Lost" which was teased for a week before being released in April.[^5]

The song was written by Raphaella, Casey Smith, Patrick Jordan-Patrikios, Boy Matthews, Youthonix & Cher Lloyd while it was mixed and mastered by Lex Barkey. Hitimpulse produced the song and have been consistent collaborators with Cher doing production on 2018's "None Of My Business" and additional production on 2019's "M.I.A".[^6]

# Critical Reception

Mike Wass of Idolator called the song a "cute bop" stating "Cher Lloyd returns with a fiery kiss-off anthem called 'Lost', which is the musical equivalent of posturing on social media so your ex can see how amazing your life is."[^7] While Pip Williams writing for The Line Of Best Fit stated "Lost" is far and away the strongest release of Lloyd's career to date, blowing those who still reference "Swagger Jagger" as a career high out of the water. The new cut sees Lloyd embrace languid balladry as a vehicle for a surprisingly hard-hitting lyric. It's still slickly produced and radio-friendly, but there's a heart and soul to it that many mainstream stars would struggle to match."[^8]

# Music video

The official video to the single premiered on YouTube the day of release. The video was shot in a single take with no cuts or edits made, depicting Lloyd on a bed with neon and pastel lights changing behind her as she sings. Lloyd commented in an Instagram Livestream that the lighting was the most difficult aspect of filming the video. The video was produced by Phase Films and directed by frequent collaborator Raja Virdi who worked on her previous single "M.I.A".[^9]

# Lyrics

<font size="3" face="Comic Sans MS, Comic Sans, cursive">
[Verse 1]<br>
I heard from a friend of a friend<br>
That you've been checking back in, Mhm-mhm<br>
'Cause I said goodbye, moved overnight<br>
And you haven't heard much since then<br>
Wondering how I'm doing now<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
It's none of your business, first of all<br>
Wondering how I'm doing now<br>
But if you've got to know, well sure<br>
Well sure<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You think I'd be lost<br>
Think I'd be lost without you, lost<br>
Is it hard knowing you're wrong?<br>
See I got lots without you, lots without you<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Great sex in the morning, sex in the morning, someone to hold me<br>
I got lo-oh-oh-oh-oh, lots<br>
Stay out in the nighttime, out in the nighttime, have me a wild time<br>
I got lo-oh-oh-oh-oh, lots<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
You heard from a friend of a friend<br>
That I've been doing just fine, I-I<br>
You don't want me, you just want me<br>
To keep wanting you all of the time<br>
But if you were wondering<br>
<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
It's none of your business first of all<br>
Wondering how I'm doing now<br>
But if you've got to know, well sure<br>
Well sure<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You think I'd be lost<br>
Think I'd be lost without you, lost<br>
Is it hard knowing you're wrong?<br>
See I got lots without you, lots without you<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Great sex in the morning, sex in the morning, someone to hold me<br>
I got lo-oh-oh-oh-oh, lots (Yeah)<br>
Stay out in the nighttime, out in the nighttime, have me a wild time<br>
I got lo-oh-oh-oh-oh, lots<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
To be honest, I think I dodged a bullet with you<br>
And I don't know how I didn't see it coming, but ooh<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Yeah, you got a God complex<br>
Now I'm thanking God you're my ex<br>
I hope you don't trip up on yourself<br>
If you think you're so hot, go back to hell (Go back to hell)<br>
'Cause you think that I'd...<br>
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
You think I'd be lost (Be lost, be lost)<br>
Think I'd be lost without you, lost<br>
Is it hard knowing you're wrong? (Knowing you're wrong)<br>
See I got lots without you, lots without you<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Great sex in the morning, sex in the morning, someone to hold me<br>
I got lo-oh-oh-oh-oh, lots (Yeah)<br>
Stay out in the nighttime, out in the nighttime, have me a wild time<br>
I got lo-oh-oh-oh-oh, lots<br>
<br>
[Outro]<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
